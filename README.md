C# Learning Journy:

DAY 1:

In the first day of our journy to learn C# we discuss several topics:

1-Front and Back End in general and their programming langueges.
2-Visual studio code.
3-Solution and project.
4-Project Code structure.

#Front and Back End

I learn that In web development the front end refers to the user interface and what the user interact with,
but the back end involves the server side development and database.Also, each one use different programming langueges
for example we can use HTML, CSS and JavaScript and all these langueges used in Front-End Framework. 
However, we can use C#, PHP and visual basic and we use it in Back-End Framework.and in our journy we will focus in C#.

C# is one of the programming language developed by Microsoft. it is desigend for bulding variety of 
application in .NET framework including desktop, web and mopile applocation in addetion 
C# is a cross-platform which can run in multiple platform including Windows, IOS and Linux.

#Visual Studio Code

In this section we learned how to install the packeges of C# and create a new project and choose the 
platforms and project type.

#Solution and project

Solution is the one thing that i learn in the first day and I found it interesting and I will explain why.
So solution is like a container or wrapper for big projects, it is include web app, desktop app and mopile app 
so we can create many project inside one solution. thts mean we can build one code can run for many projects.

#Project  Code Structure

Project in C# always contain four importent things:
* NameSpace: name of the project.
* Class Program.
* Main():each project should has one Main() only.
* Console:line commend interface used to interact with the user in other word it is a text
interface where user can enter data.

At the end of the lecture we practiced writing the project code structure.


DAY 2:

In the second day of our journy to learn C# we discuss several topics:

1-Commen Type System
2-Expression and Comparison Operators 
3-Logical Operators 
4-Shortcuts

#Commen Type System

I learn that Commen Type System (CTS) divided into two data type , Value Type and Reference Type.
I will explain the different between them.

*Value Type: data of known size like numbers such as age or phone number also true and false value
and these data stored in Stack which hase a limitid size of memory. 
(bool - byte - int - float - long - double)

*Reference Type: data of unknown size like discreption and names and these data stored in a stack 
inside the Heap which the name identifier save in stack and the value sve in heap and the 
variable indicate to the value location.
(String - Class - Object - Interface)

=> every data type balong to Object

(CLS)==> Commen Language System==> its a commen factor between programming languages in .NET
 so that we can use all this languages of this framework in one project.


#Expression and Comparison Operators

In this section we learn about Comparison operators types in C# but before I will tel you about 
String Concatenation which we can use it when we need to connect variables togather 
and there is two ways to write it .

Regular Concatenation( plus sign ):
String FirstName = "Asma";
String LastName = "Alharrasi";
String FullName = ( " My full name is : " + FirstName  +" " + LastName );  

String interpolation:
String FullName = ($‚ÄùMy full name is : {FirstName} {LastName} ");

Now I will Explain what I understand about Expression and Comparison Operators so basicly 
Expression is combination of things like numbers, variables and operators that when you put them
togather will giv us a single result for example x - b are combination of variables and operator and the 
result is the sub of the value you stored in the variableas.
