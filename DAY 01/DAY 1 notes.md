C# Learning Journy:

DAY 1:-

In the first day of our journy to learn C# we discuss several topics:-
1-Front and Back End in general and their programming langueges.
2-Visual studio code.
3-Solution and project.
4-Project Code structure.

#Front and Back End

I learn that In web development the front end refers to the user interface and what the user interact with,
but the back end involves the server side development and database.Also, each one use different programming langueges
for example we can use HTML, CSS and JavaScript and all these langueges used in Front-End Framework. 
However, we can use C#, PHP and visual basic and we use it in Back-End Framework.and in our journy we will focus in C#.

C# is one of the programming language developed by Microsoft. it is desigend for bulding variety of 
application in .NET framework including desktop, web and mopile applocation in addetion 
C# is a cross-platform which can run in multiple platform including Windows, IOS and Linux.

#Visual Studio Code

In this section we learned how to install the packeges of C# and create a new project and choose the 
platforms and project type.

#Solution and project

Solution is the one thing that i learn in the first day and I found it interesting and I will explain why.
So solution is like a container or wrapper for big projects, it is include web app, desktop app and mopile app 
so we can create many project inside one solution. thts mean we can build one code can run for many projects.

#Project  Code Structure

Project in C# always contain four importent things:-
* NameSpace: name of the project.
* Class Program.
* Main():each project should has one Main() only.
* Console:line commend interface used to interact with the user in other word it is a text
interface where user can enter data.

At the end of the lecture we practiced writing the project code structure.
